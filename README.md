# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! ðŸŽ„

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. I am working on these challenges to improve my programming skills. I am not competing, but rather completing the challenges at my own pace whenever I find the time.

## Structure

Each year's challenges are organized into their respective directories. Within each directory, you will find my solutions for each day.

## Languages Used

I will mostly be using Python for these as it is my primary language, but I will occasionally also use this as an opportunity to learn new languages. I will specify the language used in the solution's directory.

Whilst my soltions may not be the most efficient, I will try to make them as pythonic and optimised as I know how. It is my intention to avoid libraries in cases where they over simplify the problem, but I will use them where they are useful. For example I will not use `numpy` for simple matrix operations where that is the entire problem, but I will use `numpy` for more complex problems where it is useful.
