# Advent of code 2022

This is my attempt at the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges. I'm using this as an opportunity to demonstrate my skills in Python and to learn more about the language. I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn more about git and GitHub.

I intend to complete the challenges first in Python, and then in Julia using it as an opportunity to learn the language from the ground up. 

## Challenges

### Day 1 through 6:

I was playing catch up on these challenges, and still have days 7 - 9 to complete. These were interesting puzzles, and I particularly enjoyed the box stacking puzzle in day 5, though I am sure a much more efficient solution exists utilising regex.
